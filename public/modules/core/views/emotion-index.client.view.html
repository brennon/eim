            <p translate>Here, we are displaying the ‘Arousal Index’ we
                calculated from your physiological signals while you were
                listening to the media excerpt, on a scale from 1 to 100. A
                higher index indicates that you were more emotionally aroused
                to the excerpt you heard as compared to a lower index.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center" translate>Your emotion index:</h2>

            <h1 class="text-center">{{ emotionIndices[1] }} / 100</h1>

            <p translate>We hope you enjoyed the experiment! Scan this QR code
                for a link to a 3D model of your "arousal" that you can print!
