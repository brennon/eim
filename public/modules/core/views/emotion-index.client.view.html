            <p translate>Here, we are displaying the "arousal index" we
                calculated from your physiological signals, on a scale from 1 to 100. We talk about "emotions" having two
                parts: valence and arousal. Valence is a measure of how positive or negative an emotion is, and arousal
                is simply a measure of the intensity of emotion. The score below reflects how much your arousal
                increased as you listened to the music selection.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center" translate>Your emotion index:</h2>
